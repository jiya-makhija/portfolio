      <h2>Proposition: Kansas is overburdened as an abortion access point in the Midwest.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="project2/Kansas_Map.png" alt="Kansas abortion load map" width="100%" />
          <figcaption> Kansas stands out for having a high abortion load ratio, indicating it provides care to many out-of-state patients compared to in-state demand.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Used abortion load ratio as the main metric</strong> (Score: 2 – earnest)<br>
            I used the ratio of abortions by occurrence to abortions by residence to highlight states where more people are traveling in for care. Kansas stands out here, since it performs almost twice as many abortions as it does for its own residents. It’s a straightforward but powerful way to show how much the state is relied on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Used a red gradient to emphasize high-burden states</strong> (Score: 1 – slightly persuasive)<br>
            I applied a color scale from gray to red, where red means a high abortion load ratio. This instantly draws the viewer’s attention to Kansas without changing the data — it just frames it more strongly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Called out Kansas with a bold annotation</strong> (Score: 1.5 – persuasive)<br>
            I added a large label directly on Kansas to highlight its abortion load. It reinforces the message and helps guide the reader's focus toward the state I want them to notice first.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Included a simple formula explanation in the caption</strong> (Score: 2 – earnest)<br>
            Since the concept of “abortion load ratio” isn’t obvious to everyone, I added a short explanation under the chart. It helps make the visualization more transparent while still letting the color and title push the main story.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="project2/Colorado_Map.png" alt="No. of abortions map, higlighting Colorado" width="100%" />
          <figcaption>Colorado recorded the highest total abortions in the region in 2020, highlighting its broader role in providing access — regardless of patient origin.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Focused on total abortions instead of ratios</strong> (Score: 2 – earnest)<br>
            I used the raw number of abortions performed in each state. This puts the spotlight on Colorado, which did more abortions than Kansas or any of its neighbors — even though Kansas gets more attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Added a label on Colorado to highlight its numbers</strong> (Score: 1 – persuasive)<br>
            I used a direct annotation to call out Colorado’s 13,420 abortions in 2020. This helped shift the reader’s focus away from Kansas and toward Colorado as the real leader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Left out abortion load ratio and clinic counts</strong> (Score: -1 – slightly deceptive)<br>
            I chose not to show how many clinics each state has or how strained they might be. By leaving out those details, the map emphasizes Colorado’s high numbers without raising questions about access or clinic capacity — which makes the story simpler, but also a little misleading.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kept the same red color scale as the first graph</strong> (Score: -0.5 – mildly deceptive)<br>
            I used the same color palette as the Kansas map to make this chart feel visually connected, even though it shows a different metric (total abortions instead of abortion load ratio). That visual similarity might make people assume the same kind of comparison is being made, which could mislead.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      
        <p>At the start, I was honestly overwhelmed by how many different columns were in the dataset. Depending on which one I picked, I realized I could tell completely different stories. When I first explored abortion load ratio, it felt like a strong way to show something persuasive - that Kansas is handling more abortions than its own residents need, meaning people are traveling there. It became the focus of the first visualization because the ratio clearly showed that more people were coming to Kansas than leaving it for care. I used color and a direct label to guide attention, without doing anything to distort the data itself.</p>
        <p>For the second visualization, I wanted to push back on the idea that Kansas was the most overburdened. So I switched to total abortion counts instead of ratios. This was a more deceptive choice, not because the numbers were wrong, but because it left out context. I didn’t mention how many clinics each state had, which is important when talking about actual burden. This made Colorado seem like the state doing the most, without explaining why. That trade-off between simplicity and full context was one of the hardest parts.</p>
        <p>To me, ethical visualization is about helping the viewer understand a trend or issue without hiding important context. It doesn’t mean you cannot be persuasive, I think it just means that you are being upfront about how the chart is shaped and what’s left out. But it turns misleading when you ignore key parts of the story or make it hard for people to tell what’s missing. What surprised me most was how easy it is to cross that line without realizing, even just choosing one column over another can change the entire message.</p>
